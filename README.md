# Midi

Midi is a MIDI synthesizer that plays Bach's [Goldberg Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_Variations) using PySynth B piano samples. Notes are shown on a scrolling piano roll view as they are played, based on the standard 88 piano keys with the treble at the top. Playback automatically advances to the next song on the list.

Press the right and left cursor keys to go to the next/previous track. Adjust playback speed with the up and down cursor keys. Press Space to pause playback.
